## Released games

### <a href="/projects/#consensus-together" style="color: green">Consensus | Together</a>

A pair of complete, pay-what-you-want one-page narrative roleplaying games about a group of people working together to do something about the state of the world, and the importance of the rules that guide our interactions.

## <a href="/projects/#open-source-contributions" style="color: green">Open Source Contributions</a>

We believe that open source is the future of games.
A significant portion of our work goes towards developing, improving and building open source tools to make building games better.

If you love our [open source tools](https://github.com/leafwing-studios/), consider sponsoring us on [Github Sponsors](hhttps://github.com/sponsors/alice-i-cecile).

### Bevy

Leafwing Studios is using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) to build its games!
Bevy is a thriving open source Rust game engine, focused on ECS-first ergonomics.
Alice is one of the core maintainers of Bevy, focusing on product management, documentation and the Entity-Component-System architecture.

We maintain several open source crates in the Bevy ecosystem, including [`leafwing_input-manager`](https://github.com/Leafwing-Studios/leafwing_input_manager) and [`leafwing_input_playback`](https://github.com/Leafwing-Studios/leafwing_input_playback).

#### Taffy

[`taffy`](https://github.com/dioxuslabs/taffy) is a pure Rust UI layout library, focused on performance, correctness and the developer experience.

We've brought this project back from the dead, and helped build a small but thriving cross-project open source community around it.
Ultimately, we hope to use this crate to help build the GUIs of our games.
