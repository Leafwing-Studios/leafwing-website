## Actively developed games

### [Fonts of Power](projects/index.md#fonts-of-power)

An original d20 roleplaying game (for both the tabletop and PC!) about magical places that have taken on a life of their own.

### [Emergence](projects/index.md#emergence)

An organic factory builder that explores themes of complexity, robustness and indirect control.

## Released games

### [Consensus | Together](projects/index.md#consensus-together)

A pair of complete, pay-what-you-want one-page narrative roleplaying games about a group of people working together to do something about the state of the world, and the importance of the rules that guide our interactions.

## [Open Source Contributions](projects/index.md#open-source-contributions)

We believe that open source is the future of games.
A significant portion of our work goes towards developing, improving and building open source tools to make building games better.

If you love our [open source tools](https://github.com/leafwing-studios/), consider funding this work us on [Github Sponsors](hhttps://github.com/sponsors/alice-i-cecile).

### [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)

Our game engine of choice.
Bevy is a thriving open source Rust game engine, focused on ECS-first ergonomics and a powerful modular design.
Alice is one of the core maintainers of Bevy, focusing on product management, documentation and the Entity-Component-System architecture.

We maintain several open source crates in the Bevy ecosystem, including [`leafwing_input-manager`](https://github.com/Leafwing-Studios/leafwing_input_manager) and [`leafwing_input_playback`](https://github.com/Leafwing-Studios/leafwing_input_playback).

#### [Taffy](https://github.com/dioxuslabs/taffy)

A pure Rust UI layout library, focused on performance, correctness and a painless developer experience (well, as painless as flexbox can be).

We've brought this project back from the dead, and helped build a small but thriving cross-project open source community around it.
Ultimately, we hope to use this crate to help build the GUIs of our games.
