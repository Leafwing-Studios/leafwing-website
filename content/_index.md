*Leafwing Studios* is a fledgling Canadian indie games studio, founded in 2020 to make richer, more thoughtful games.
Whether we're making tabletop games or video games, we care about:

* more sustainable, equitable and sensible business models for game development
* better design and prototyping practices
* creating memorable, replayable experiences through emergent design

You'll catch us [blogging](../blog/) about our  [projects](../projects/), game design, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) and better ways to create and collaborate.
