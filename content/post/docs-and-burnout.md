Bad docs are often caused by:

- building before you design
- an unsustainable feature velocity
- no emphasis on product quality

They can cause a death spiral for your project because:

1. Bad docs reduce your project's popularity
2. Bad docs increase support burden
3. Bad docs are a barrier to new contributors
4. Bad docs force you to hold the hand of new contributors when they're working
5. Bad docs make it hard to pick up again after a break
