If you're making or designing a game for the first time, it's likely that you'll follow a process that looks something like this:

1. Find a game that you thought was interesting.
2. Make some tweaks to the design of that game.
3. Implement that design.
4. Play the game and see if it's fun.
5. If it's not fun, change some stuff to try and make it fun and repeat.

Here at Leafwing Studios, we refer to this as design-by-stumble: you might have some vague idea of where you're going, but you can never see very far in front of you, and are likely to trip over unexpected problems.
Rather than moving towards a specific creative vision, this process tends to result in random iteration on existing art.
While this eventually results in something slightly better, it often develops unnecessary, vestigial pieces in the process, and it takes a long time.
