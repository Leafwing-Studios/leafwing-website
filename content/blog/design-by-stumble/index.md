- We all get this feeling of "what if thing that I like, but made by me?"
	- This is a common thing, and it's easy to hype yourself up about projects this way
	- But this generally doesn't lead to good outcomes
	- I've seen a lot of designs and projects by amateur designers that feel boring, derivative, bloated in scope, and full of vestigial features
	- What's going on here, why does this happen, and how do we do better?
- Design by stumble is where you take a thing you like and make some random changes and call it done
	- "What if thing that I like, but made by me?"
	- This is *not* making a game in the same genre as another game. Inspiration is good!
	- Design by stumble is actually defined by a lack of goals and vision
- Common with amateur designers, especially those working solo
- Why do people do this?
	- Lack of creativity
	- People want to make things that are similar to the things that they like, but analysis is hard. So instead of figuring out what parts of the thing are enjoyable, or why they like them, they just kinda copy the thing wholesale.
	- People don't think about overall goals or market segments, and are driven by what they think is cool
- Stumbling around is totally fine if you just want to learn, explore a space, play with some ideas, etc. But it falls apart if you actually want to make something, y'know, *good*. 
- Design by stumble is generally doesn't get good results. It's unprincipled, and usually the random changes aren't actually helpful
	- Derivative, obviously
	- Iteration isn't inherently flawed, but it needs *direction* to evaluate if the iterative changes have actually improved the product. And direction means you need high level goals to evaluate against.
	- Also, static analysis is very good, and can dramatically cut down on the need for iteration in the first place. Think before you stumble!
	- Even seemingly small changes can have significant and far-reaching effects, often unintuitively
	- Goals are also very useful for aligning vision and understanding when working on a team
	- It's very easy to bloat your scope into something huge
	- Copying something else may sign you up for a ton of work if you're coping something big (medium specific: video games)
- Tangent: no, this is not why there are so many derivative games on the market
	- These mostly happen because an exec said "look at [game] making money! we want to make that money!"
	- And then telling everyone to copy the successful thing
- Actually making good games: A principled approach
	- What are the goals of the project?
	- Target audience? (and opposite)
	- Inspirations? (yes, these are good to have actually)
	- Anti-inspirations? (useful for quickly rejecting distractions!)
	- Check the early design documents for things like emblematic


"My game is like [popular thing] meets [other similar popular thing]" is a major red flag for this.

..

I think everyone who dabbles in game design at least sometimes gets this feeling of "what if [thing that I like], but made by me!"

"I love God of War. Wouldn't it be awesome if there was a game that was a lot like God of War, but like, I was the one who made it!?"

"Man, Minecraft is so cool. I'd love it if I made a game and at the end of the process, it was just like Minecraft, because Minecraft is really cool."

We all get this feeling!
It's a common thing, and it's a great way hype yourself up and build motivation for projects you're working on.
There's no shame in it.

But, this outlook generally doesn't lead to good outcomes.
Obviously, following this instinct blindly leads to very derivitive work, but there are lot of more subtle issues at play here.
I've seen a lot of designs and projects by amateur designers that feel boring, derivative, bloated in scope, and full of vestigial features.
It's probably the most common single problem I see when reviewing designs by hobbyists, especially those working solo.
So, what's going on here, why does this happen, and how can we do better?

## Design by Stumble

**Design by stumble** is a design pattern where you start with something that you like, make a few random iterative changes, and then call it done. 
For me, the classic example of this is taking an exisitng tabletop RPG, changing the core dice mechanic to something else (like changing from d20 to 2d6), removing a few skills, and then adding a few new ones.
One of *my* earliest design projects was basically just taking a boring JRPG template (like Final Fantasy 6) and replacing the class list with 4 much less interesting ones.
(Unfortunately the original notes for this project have been lost. Otherwise I would *love* to rip it apart publicly sometime as a learning experience.)
I've also seen *a lot* of homebrew for *Dungeons & Dragons* that falls into this category.

To be clear, this is distinct from taking *inspiration* from previous work.
Firstly, inspiration is generally more removed than the process being described above.
When designing by stumble, the inspiring work is used as a *starting point*.
It's like taking a whole painting and then painting on your own additions over top of what's there.
Healthier inspiration is more like taking the outlines or broad strokes from a painting, sketching it on the canvas using a pencil, and then using that as guidance.

More concretely, when a skilled designer takes inspiration from other work, they typically start not by hacking on it, but by *analyzing* it.
The first stage is focused on determinging which parts of that work were effective, which parts weren't, and *why*.
Instead of grabbing mechanics and ideas uncritically- those ideas are evaluated against the project's *goals* to see if they would be a good fit.

And that really is the key piece here: design by stumble isn't defined by taking functioning pieces from other works.
It's defined by a lack of *goals* and *vision*.

And, to be clear, there's nothing inherently *wrong* with that!
Designing by stumble is a great way to experiment, try out new ideas, explore new genres/mediums, and most importantly, to learn and improve as a designer.
Up above, I mentioned one of my early design projects. 
And although that project was a mess, I don't hate or malign it.
It was a valuable learning experience for me, and doing projects like that made me a better designer in the long run.

But... that project *was* a mess.
And that's the rub.
Because design by stumble really falls apart if you want to make something that's, y'know, *good*.

## Why doesn't design by sumble work?
