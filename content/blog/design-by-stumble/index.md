- We all get this feeling of "what if thing that I like, but made by me?"
	- This is a common thing, and it's easy to hype yourself up about projects this way
	- But this generally doesn't lead to good outcomes
	- I've seen a lot of designs and projects by amateur designers that feel boring, derivative, bloated in scope, and full of vestigial features
	- What's going on here, why does this happen, and how do we do better?
- Design by stumble is where you take a thing you like and make some random changes and call it done
	- "What if thing that I like, but made by me?"
	- This is *not* making a game in the same genre as another game. Inspiration is good!
	- Design by stumble is actually defined by a lack of goals and vision
- Common with amateur designers, especially those working solo
- Why do people do this?
	- Lack of creativity
	- People want to make things that are similar to the things that they like, but analysis is hard. So instead of figuring out what parts of the thing are enjoyable, or why they like them, they just kinda copy the thing wholesale.
	- People don't think about overall goals or market segments, and are driven by what they think is cool
- Stumbling around is totally fine if you just want to learn, explore a space, play with some ideas, etc. But it falls apart if you actually want to make something, y'know, *good*. 
- Design by stumble is generally doesn't get good results. It's unprincipled, and usually the random changes aren't actually helpful
	- Derivative, obviously
	- Iteration isn't inherently flawed, but it needs *direction* to evaluate if the iterative changes have actually improved the product. And direction means you need high level goals to evaluate against.
	- Also, static analysis is very good, and can dramatically cut down on the need for iteration in the first place. Think before you stumble!
	- Even seemingly small changes can have significant and far-reaching effects, often unintuitively
	- Goals are also very useful for aligning vision and understanding when working on a team
	- It's very easy to bloat your scope into something huge
- Tangent: no, this is not why there are so many derivative games on the market
	- These mostly happen because an exec said "look at [game] making money! we want to make that money!"
	- And then telling everyone to copy the successful thing
- Actually making good games: A principled approach
	- What are the goals of the project?
	- Target audience? (and opposite)
	- Inspirations? (yes, these are good to have actually)
	- Anti-inspirations? (useful for quickly rejecting distractions!)
	- Check the early design documents for things like emblematic
