## Prototype

* *Fonts of Power:* a tactical roleplaying game about adventure in magical places.
By using the same set of [rules](https://rules.fontsofpower.com/#/) for both the tabletop and video game, this game pushes the boundaries of both.

## Design

* *Emergence:* an organic factory builder that explores themes of complexity, robustness and indirect control.

## Contributions

* *Bevy:* a brilliant ergonomic ECS [game engine](https://bevyengine.org/) written in Rust.
We use Bevy to make our games, and are giving back by helping organize the work that needs to be done, designing innovative features for the ECS and steadily making the engine easier to learn and use.
