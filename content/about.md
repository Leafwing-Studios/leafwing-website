*Leafwing Studios* is a fledgling Canadian indie games studio, founded in 2020 to make richer, more thoughtful games.
Whether we're making tabletop games or board games, we care about:

* more sustainable, equitable and sensible business models for game development
* better design and prototyping practices
* creating memorable, replayable experiences through emergent complexity

You'll catch us [blogging](/blog/) about our [projects](/content/projects.md), game design, Rust, Bevy and better ways to create and collaborate.
